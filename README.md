# OOP-coursework
This course project was developed to demonstrate the acquired skills in developing software systems based on the high-level programming language C++ and its object-oriented design tools, studied during the course "Object-oriented Programming". The selected subject area "Higher Educational Institution" was modeled and analyzed based on the given business logic. The software system implements the basic functions of an automated information system, such as storing and displaying various types of data, adding and deleting them using console database tools represented by vectors. Other features of the STL library, such as built-in algorithms and file stream management, were also applied.
